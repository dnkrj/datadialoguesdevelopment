      <section>
        <p>We heard this from people in care and people with chronic health conditions</p>
        <p>The lives of people with sensory loss, dementia or another severe disability can be transformed by data sharing. However, accessible services are often unavailable or people lack choice over how they share their data. Nonetheless, these services can offer a radical benefit, improve their life and are often positively viewed.</p>
        <h3>What we learned from Scots</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>There is an overwhelming desire for a joined up healthcare system from both the general public and those with health conditions.</li>
          <li>Some people see surveillance as a means of safety and support - it reassures them that they are being looked after</li>
          <li>Effort must be made to ensure people are given access to technology but also a fair choice over whether to use it or not</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>So... what can we do?</h3>
        <p>Designing for people with this relationship means developing inclusive and accessible user interfaces and pursuing more seamless routes for data sharing and collection. Digital services should also explore how to better integrate carers and family members into personal health management.</p>
